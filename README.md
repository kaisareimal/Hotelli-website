# Hotelli-website
Hotelli mitmeleheline veebileht. Loodud VOCO UX/UI Ãµppe veebidisaini tunni jaoks. 


This is my very first website project in HTML/CSS. I gained valuable knowledge and discovered the captivating nature of HTML/CSS, which has ignited a desire within me to further practice my skills in this department.
The project aimed to create a user-friendly and responsive website that would be inviting and adhere to best practices. I believe I successfully achieved the intended goals of the project.
